# this too shall pass

i think a lot about this quote. it's not attributed to anyone in specific, although people do accredit its popularity to the 19th century poet Edward FitzGerald.

a lot of people tend to compare their struggles and their issues and lives to other people, feeling bad about what they've done in stark comparison to other people. many people go down depressive spirals sometimes, scrolling social media and wishing their life was like theirs. that's me too. i do that rarely, but it's always destructive and unhelpful.

but then i think a lot about this quote. it's interesting because even though it's used for motivational advice on dealing with trauma or some past event, it applies to normalcy too. "this too shall pass", meaning that *even the present is passing by.* yes, everything passes, even the good times. it's a sort of testament to people don't really realize how small we are in the face of well, everything. and yet we still try, and that's pretty impressive.

an example right now: the unending stress of senior year work and exams. taking 5 aps in one year is not easy, i don't get how there are people out there are able to do 9 - but maybe that's just a testament to my work ethic. sometimes i procrastinate everything and then spiral into doubt about whether i'll get it all done, but then i'm reminded of the quote. "this too shall pass." no matter what, when i'm done with this, it will be over - i will not think about it anymore. the hard, stressful weeks of theatre/play practice on top of schoolwork and having to get volunteer hours and doing obligations?

they've all gone by so fast. i took a workshop recently that illustrated this point much more clearly, in fact. it was at States for thespians, and i learnt a lot about how we tend to ignore what our body can do in favor of what the mind thinks we can do. our body knows much better than we do - we can push beyond our "mental" limits, essentially doing something we thought we couldn't do. people think they can't handle a full day of work and activities and other things, and all just want to go home and drop everything and go into a deep sleep. but then they force themselves to.. and they like it? it's actually not quite so bad then.

and when you're able to physically manifest this quote, pass into the eclipse where you're not thinking about anything but the moment? that is a rare moment. i remember many times when i just stop thinking about anything - past or future - and just stare off into space, and talk to myself out loud.

who am i? what am i doing here? how did i get here? and i trace back the paths of all my pasts and all the futures that ever was, and i affirm to myself this is the right one, because everything i have done is authentically me. i cannot be something i am not, and i cannot do more than i am not physically, bodily, capable of. all the choices i have made are the right ones, because they are the only ones that have happened - these alternate thoughts, timelines, are nothing more than spirits of what could have been.

i still don't know who i am. sometimes i feel like i'm just other people around me, reflecting off other people's personalities like a mirror, but deep down i know there's something more there.

## and i have to find it
