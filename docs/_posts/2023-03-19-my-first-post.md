# this is my very first post and also a rant on a part of myself

essentially this is the introduction to my blog and myself i guess. it's pretty anticlimatic to say the least but here's a song: **The Less I Know The Better by Tame Impala**. it's pretty nostalgic to me because i remember when i first found this song and needless to say my music taste was *absolutely revolutionized.* 

my music taste previously was terrifying like ajr and other horrible artists i cannot bring myself to mention because middle school me didn't really know how to really do music or know good music artists. i was virtually blind to the world of music and i had no idea what genres even were, but that's ok;

because i'm completely deaf. not completely but i wear cochlear implants. to explain a little bit about me i was born this way and got my implants at like 2 years old. which is pretty normal for cochlear implant wearers, though i know there's controversy about if a baby can consent to something like that. i certainly didn't like it; i threw my implants on the floor all the time. but i still love hearing to this day <sub>please don't hate on me Deaf community this is just my opinion</sub> but either way, my complete "congential deafness" (as it is referred to) is caused by a connexin 26 mutation. this mutation was because my mom and dad both had the same recessive gene that they just happened to carry onto my brother and me by accident.. and it was about a one in four chance for both of us. to be honest that's insane.

my life though hasn't really felt different from other people. but being Deaf does get in the way of a lot (btw, i use the capital Deaf because that's what you use to refer to people who are pre-lingually deaf) and especially when it comes to talking to people. i _hate_ crowds. i hate being in cafeterias, crowded places, or anywhere with a significant amount of noise. nobody notices it because nobody knows what it's like except for other people with hearing impairments. it sucks. i did not talk to anyone in the freshman year of high school because i could not understand anyone.

and so comes the age old debate about whether being Deaf is a disability. my opinion? it's how you frame it, really. i like being deaf whenever it helps me or whenever it's being neutral. like for example, at night, i can't hear anything or anyone. which is a blessing compared to hearing everything at night. but i consider it a disability whenever i can't hear someone, and then they're like "blah blah blah" and i'm like "what'd you say?" and then they repeat it and i repeat it over and over. it's exhausting.

but at the same time i would not really change who i am in any way. despite all the awkwardness and all the setbacks it gives me, being Deaf is never a bad thing. but it is *kind* of weird that i am Deaf and know bare minimum asl (some words, finger spelling with the alphabet) which means i can't really communicate with other deaf people... but i'm also not able to like, communicate with hearing people???????? i'm stuck between two worlds basically.
